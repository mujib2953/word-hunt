2. Installing **Material UI** (Core module)
    `npm install @material-ui/core`
3. We will run our app on local dev server by following command

4. In the mean time we are deleting some un-necessory files. We will be deleting
    - App.test.js
    - logo.svg
    - reportWebVitals.js
    - setupTests.js
5. Remove the refernces of deleted files from the existing files, also clear the contents of `App.css` so that we don't have any custom stylings.
6. To call api, we need `axios` package to be installted, to do so we run following command
    `npm i axios` or `npm install axios`
7. Lets call `https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/<language_code>/<word>` api with language code as **en** and word as **plane**, we created the `dictionary` function in `App.js` and calling this form `useEffect` hooks with an empty dependencies which act as the `componentDidMount` LCM.
8. We print the output in the console and also cathc any error which may arise.
